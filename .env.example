# IPPAN Explorer Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and configure for your environment

# =============================================================================
# Server-side RPC Configuration (RECOMMENDED)
# =============================================================================
# Server-only env var for the RPC gateway URL.
# This is NOT exposed to the browser and is the preferred way to configure RPC.
# The API routes (e.g., /api/rpc/status) will use this to proxy requests.
#
# IMPORTANT: This is the ONLY variable you need to set for production.
IPPAN_RPC_BASE_URL=http://188.245.97.41:8080

# =============================================================================
# Public RPC Configuration (for display only)
# =============================================================================
# These NEXT_PUBLIC_ vars are exposed to the browser but are ONLY used for
# display purposes (showing users what RPC endpoint is being used).
# 
# IMPORTANT: All actual RPC requests from the browser go through the
# /api/rpc/* proxy to avoid mixed-content issues (HTTPS -> HTTP blocked).
# The browser NEVER makes direct HTTP requests to the RPC gateway.
#
# You can leave these unset - the explorer will work fine without them.
# If set, they're shown in the UI for debugging purposes.
NEXT_PUBLIC_IPPAN_RPC_BASE=http://188.245.97.41:8080

# =============================================================================
# Demo Mode (NEVER use in production)
# =============================================================================
# Set to "true" to enable mock/demo data fallback (for development only).
# Default is "false" - production should NEVER enable this.
#
# When false (default):
#   - All data comes from the real RPC gateway
#   - Mock data functions throw errors if called
#   - This ensures you see real DevNet data
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=false

# =============================================================================
# Vercel Deployment Notes
# =============================================================================
# For Vercel deployments:
#
# 1. Set IPPAN_RPC_BASE_URL in Vercel Environment Variables (server-side)
# 2. Optionally set NEXT_PUBLIC_IPPAN_RPC_BASE for display purposes
# 3. Ensure NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE is NOT set or set to "false"
#
# The explorer will:
# - Use /api/rpc/* proxy for all RPC calls (HTTPS-safe)
# - Never make direct HTTP calls to the gateway from the browser
# - Show clear error states if the gateway is unreachable

# =============================================================================
# Legacy / Back-compat Vars (auto-detected if present)
# =============================================================================
# These are supported for backwards compatibility but not recommended:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_NODE_RPC
# NEXT_PUBLIC_IPPAN_RPC_URL
# NEXT_PUBLIC_IPPAN_RPC_FALLBACK
# NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL
# NEXT_PUBLIC_EXPLORER_API
# VITE_NODE_RPC
# IPPAN_RPC_URL
# IPPAN_RPC_BASE
